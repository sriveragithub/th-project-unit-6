            "description": "We started Art District with the desire to create a space for underrepresented and emerging artists, curators, and creatives to connect and for anyone who loves art to learn the stories of unique artists, new and established. The focus of this app is to give exposure to the stories, experiences and masterpieces of artists from all different backgrounds and allow the public to engage with, learn about and support these diverse artists. The legacies of many artists who didn't fit the mold of the status quo have often been pushed aside throughout history. The world of art has consistently grappled with inclusivity and the importance of removing these barriers is paramount. Our mission is to serve the vibrant art community and celebrate the diversity that makes art so important.",
